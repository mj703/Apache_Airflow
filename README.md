## About Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It was developed by Airbnb and is now part of the Apache Software Foundation.

Airflow allows you to define your data pipelines as code, using Python. Workflows are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which are made up of tasks that can be run independently or in parallel. Airflow provides a web-based UI for monitoring and managing your pipelines, as well as a powerful command-line interface for interacting with the system.
